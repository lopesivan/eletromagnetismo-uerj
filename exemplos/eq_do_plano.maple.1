# 1. To construct this equation, let
#                               "A_"

# ,
#                               "B_"

# , and
#                               "C_"

#  be the vectors pointing to A, B, and C, respectively, and
#                               "r_"

#  be the position vector of any point of this plane. The differences
#                            "A_ - C_"

#  and
#                            "A_ - B_"

#  are vectors parallel to the plane we want to represent, and also the difference between
#                               "r_"

#   and any of
#                             "A_, B_"

# , or
#                               "C_"

#  is a vector parallel to the plane. So the equation of the plane can be obtained by taking the cross product of differences involving
#                             "A_, B_"

# , and
#                               "C_"

#  to construct a vector perpendicular to the plane,
G_ := (A_ - B_) &x (A_ - C_);
# then equating to zero the scalar product of
#                               "G_"

#  with any of the differences parallel to the plane involving
#                               "r_"

# . So for instance, one way of writing this vectorial equation of the plane is
Eq := (r_ - A_) . G_ = 0;
# 2. To plot this plane, turn the generic points A, B, and C into concrete points; that is, give values to the components of
#                             "A_, B_"

# , and
#                               "C_"

# . For example:
A_ := 2*_i - 3*_j + _k*4;
B_ := 5* _i + 4*_j - 7*_k;
C_ := 30/4* A_ + 90/7*B_;

# For
#                               "r_"

# we always have

r_ := x*_i + y*_j +z*_k;

# The vectorial equation for these particular points A, B, and C is thus:

Eq;

# As a verification that the surface represented by this equation contains the
# points A, B, and C, you can substitute in the values of the coordinates of
# these points and see that the equation is satisfied. These are the coordinates
# of the three points:

A, B, C := seq([seq(coeff(v, ui), ui=[_i, _j, _k])], v = [A_, B_, C_]);

# This shows that at these points, the equation is satisfied.

for P in [A, B, C] do

eval(Eq, [x = P[1], y = P[2], z = P[3]]);
od;

# That this surface is a plane is clear from the fact that Eq is linear in all
# of x, y, and z. One way of plotting this plane is to use the command
# implicitplot3d.
